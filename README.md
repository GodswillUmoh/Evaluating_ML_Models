# Evaluating Machine Learning Models
>Evaluating Machine Learning Models refers to the process of assessing the performance of a machine learning algorithm on a given dataset. This involves measuring how well the model makes predictions on unseen data (i.e., generalizes) and determining whether it meets the desired performance metrics.
